* Reading More: Users can click on a news article to open the full article in a new tab.

* Liking Articles: Each news article has a like button. Users can click on the heart icon to like or unlike an article. The liked state of articles is saved locally and is indicated by the color of the heart icon (solid for liked, outline for unliked).
